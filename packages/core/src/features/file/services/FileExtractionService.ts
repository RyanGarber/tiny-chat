/**
 * FileExtractionService — reads the formats that carry text without storing it
 * as text.
 *
 * A PDF, a Word document and a spreadsheet are all containers: the words are in
 * there, but not as bytes anything can decode. Uploads keep such a file exactly
 * as it arrived, so the unpacking happens here instead, at the moment something
 * needs to read one — a search deciding whether a document matches, or a
 * preview deciding what to show.
 *
 * Extracting at read time rather than at upload time is what keeps the original
 * file the original file. The same bytes go to a model that accepts PDFs
 * natively, download gives back the document that was sent, and improving the
 * converter improves every document already stored rather than only the next
 * one.
 *
 * The converters are large and almost never needed in a given session, so they
 * are imported on first use rather than at module load.
