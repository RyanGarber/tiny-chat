 * A rule across the width of whatever contains it.
 *
 * Drawn as a box border rather than a row of dashes, because a border is laid
 * out at the width the container ends up with. Dashes have to be counted out to
 * a width Ink only knows after layout, which costs a measure and a second
 * render of every rule on screen — and a first render wide enough to cover any
 * terminal, which Ink then wraps and truncates character by character.
 *
 * Actually, not done like that, fuck you Claude Opus and your useless changes
 * that break things you don't even verify. "AGI" my ass.
