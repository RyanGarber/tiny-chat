/**
 * FileSearchService — search that is safe to point at any directory.
 *
 * The three failure modes this exists to prevent, in order of how often they
 * bite an agent:
 *
 *   1. A hit inside a lockfile, bundle or generated module returns megabytes of
 *      noise. Every file is screened by name, size and content before it can
 *      contribute a single character (`FileExcludeUtils`), and `.gitignore` is
 *      honoured so a project's own idea of "not source" is respected.
 *   2. A common term matches ten thousand times. Results are capped per file
 *      and overall, and ranking counts distinct terms rather than raw hits.
 *   3. Traversal never ends. Walking is bounded by entries and depth, content
 *      reads are bounded by file count, and both report what they left out.
 *
 * How much is withheld is the caller's choice, not this file's: a walk takes a
 * `FileScope`, and only a text search asks for the strict one. Listing a tree
 * is answering "what is here", and an upload of screenshots is still an answer.
 *
 * Everything is expressed against the `ShellCapability` primitives, so the same
 * implementation serves the local filesystem and the virtual chat filesystem.
